Just something I was thinking about on the ride to work this morning....  We live in a time where, thanks to the propagation of the internet and sites like Wikipedia and even Google, we can answer nearly any question or curiosity we have in a matter of seconds. There is almost no question we can't find the answer for, or any topic that we can't delve into and study. All of this free, all of this available at our fingertips.

All this and I realize... I can't imagine living in a time where I might have a question that I could not find the answer for. Where I may want to learn about something, and not be able to find any knowledge of it.

I realize this is both a 'time' and 'place' thing, as not everyone in the world can experience these benefits yet. But in my small corner of the globe, this is life, and this is a very blessed life that is far too easy to take for granted.
